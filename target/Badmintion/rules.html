        <div id="whole_div">
        <H4> Why should we care about the rules?</H4>
        <P>If you follow the rules,you won’t feel lost in the middle of your games. Imagine a situation when you’re not aware of the score and your game has actually finish. Let’s say you’re playing singles. Your opponent is waiting to shake your hand at the net where as you’re preparing for your next service. How embarrassing things could
            turn up!
            
        <P>You can even call a fault on your opponent if he or she tries to break the rules to gain some advantage in the game.</P>
            
        <P> You’ll enjoy badminton even more when you play according to the proper rules.</P>
       
     <b>   Let’s begin with some simple badminton rules…</b>

             How to Play Badminton?   
           </h4>
           <p>In very simple terms

            A rally starts with a serve.</p>
            <p>A rally ends when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> the shuttle touches the ground or get caught by the net.</li>
                <li> someone commits a fault.</li>
            </ul>
 
            <p>You’ll be awarded with ONE point when you win a rally. Win 21 rallies and you’ll win the game.</p>

        <H4>TOSS</H4>
           
               
             <P> Before commencing play, the opposing sides shall toss a coin and the side winning the toss shall have the option of:</P>  
               <UL>
                   <LI>serving first,
                </LI>
                <LI>not serving first, or

                </LI>
                <LI>choosing ends

                </LI>

               </UL>
               <P>The side losing the toss shall then have the choice of any alternative remaining. Ends are changed after games one and two. If a third game is necessary, ends are changed during the game after one side has scored 11 points. </P>
        
               <h4>
                Scoring System   
              </h4>
              <ol>
<li>
    A match consists of best-of-three games to 21 points. 
</li>
<li>
    At 20 all, the side which gains a two-point lead first wins the game.
</li>
<li>
    At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point wins that game.  
</li>
<li>
    The side winning a game serves first in the next game. 
</li>
<li>
    Every time there is a serve, there will be a point scored, unless that point is replayed. 
</li>
<li>
    A two-minute break between each game is allowed.
</li>
<li>
    When the leading score reaches 11 points, players may take a 60-second break if needed.   
</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>
                Singles, doubles, and mixed doubles   
              </h4>
              <p>
                You can have either two or four players on a badminton court: one player on each side, or a team of two players on each side. One-against-one is called singles; two-against-two is called doubles.
              </p>
              <p>
                In doubles, either player can hit the shuttle; you do not have to take it in turns. The only exceptions are the first two shots of the rally; I’ll explain this when we discuss serving. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In total, there are five types of badminton:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                    Men’s singles 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Women’s singles 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Men’s doubles
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Women’s doubles
  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mixed doubles (each team is a man and a woman)
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Men’s doubles and women’s doubles are also called level doubles.

 
              </p>
              <p>
                These are the only types of badminton played in serious tournaments. In casual play, however, women sometimes play against men (e.g. two women against two men).

              <h4>Serving</h4>
             <p>Serving is how you start the rally: someone has to hit the shuttle first! To prevent the server gaining an overwhelming advantage, there are special restrictions placed on serving that don’t apply during the rest of the rally.
              
                <p> The receiver is the person who hits the second shot in the rally. In doubles, the receiver’s partner is not allowed to hit this shot.
              
             <h4> How to serve</h4>
             <p>In badminton, the serve must be hit in an upwards direction, with an underarm hitting action. You are not allowed to play a tennis style serve.
              
                <p> The main rule here is that when you hit the shuttle, it must be below your waist. To be exact, the rules define this to be a height level with the lowest part of your ribcage. In other words, you can serve from a bit higher than the top of your shorts, but not much.

    <img src=https://raliasportscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Badminton-Single-Position.jpg>
</span>
<h6>Singles</h6><p>
    The singles court is narrower than the doubles court,but the same length
</p>
<p>
    Since one person needs to cover the entire court,single tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corner of the court.

    </span>
<h6>
    Doubles
</h6>

<p>
   Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack,hitting downwards as much as possible 
</p>
<p>
    Whenever possible,a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear-court,and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift

</span>
<h6>Mixed doubles</h6>

<p>
    In mixed doubles,both pairs try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and man at the back

</p>
<p>
    This is because the male players are substantially stronger,and can therefore produce more powerful smashes
</p>

              <h4>
                Faults  
              </h4>
              <p>
                  1.If in serving, the shuttlecock is struck above the server’s waist.
              </p>
              <P>
                2.If at the serve, the shuttlecock falls into the wrong receiving court.
            </P>  <P>3.If the server’s and receiver’s feet are not within the boundaries of their serving court and receiving court, respectively.
            <P>4.If the partner of the receiver takes the serve.
            </P>
            <P>
               5.If a player touches the net with his/her racquet, person, or clothes.
            </P>
            <p>
                6.If the shuttlecock is struck in return before it has crossed the net to his/her side. (The follow-through may break the plane of the net.)
